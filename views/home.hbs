            presenting content on the World Wide Web.It is the backbone of any
            webpage. All other programming languages are built on top of html.
            It can be labelled as the skeleton of websites. Any Html file would
            have a start tag and an end tag. They are also known as html
            elements. Elements are the basic building blocks of a website.
